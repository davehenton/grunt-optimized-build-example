# Grunt optimized build example 

> Autoloading of Grunt tasks 

> Parallel execution of Grunt tasks

> Optimized and minified assets

> Code quality assurance

With this example I will share my experience how making the build process faster with autoloading of Grunt tasks and to 
parallelize as much as possible. I show you how to build a fully fledged front-end build process with optimized assets 
and how to ensure the code quality.
